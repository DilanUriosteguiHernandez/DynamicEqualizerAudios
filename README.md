# Dynamic Equalizer Audios

The Dynamic Equalizer Audios repository contains the audio files utilized in the paper "Algorithm for the Attenuation of Resonant Frequencies in a Dynamic Audio Equalizer," which were employed to assess the efficacy of the algorithm. The audio files have a duration of 4 seconds per file, with a bit depth of 24 bits at a sampling rate of 48 kHz.

The audio files were procured from a variety of multitrack projects accessible within the Mixing Secrets for the Small Studio â€“ Additional Resources library, provided by Cambridge Music Technology. These files were utilized to obtain audio samples of different instruments for experimental purposes.

The audio files are organized in folders according to the type of instrument, as follows:

- Acoustic Guitar
- Baritone Saxophone
- Brass
- Drums
- Drums OverHeads

- Trombone
- Trumpet
- Violin
- Vocal Man 1
- Vocal Man 2
- Vocal Woman 1
- Vocal Woman 2

Each folder contains files bearing the following labels:

- InputNameInstrument (This represents the unprocessed audio file)
- OutputNameInstrument (This represents the audio file that has undergone processing by the developed plug-in)
